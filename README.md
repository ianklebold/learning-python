# PYTHONIC CODE
If you want have a pythonic code, apply this practice you may


Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases arent special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Erros should never pass silently.
Unless explicity silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There sould be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvios at first unless you are Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
**If the implementation is hard to explain, is a bad idea.**
**If the implementation is easy to explain, is may be a good idea.**
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- lets do more of those!
